data, or other languages.


espeak 1.48.03  04.04.2014

Fix bug, use of the command-line  "espeakedit --compile" produced phoneme data
in which vowels started at full amplitude instead of gradual increase.

Fix bug:  SSML <break time=""> with values greater than 23 seconds were ignored
due to arithmetic overflow.

Added new function:  ChangeNextPhoneme().

Language changes include: da, en, fa, gu, hu, it, nl, pt, ta

all words in the *_list file which don't have the $only attribute.



espeak 1.48.01  02.02.2014

*_rules files:
Added rule attribute $noprefix.  The rule is not used if a prefix has been removed from the word.
