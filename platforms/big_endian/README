espeak-utils
============

A utility to convert the phonindex, phontab and phondata to
big-endian form if necessary.

* espeak-phoneme-data

  This is the little-endian to big-endian conversion tool. It uses an
  external file (by default called 'phondata-manifest') in order to convert
  the phondata file.

The 'phondata-manifest' file is produced by espeakedit when it compiles
the phoneme data.  If it is not present here, find it in the espeak-data directory.

NOTE: 
The format of espeak-data/phondata changed in eSpeak version 1.47.  The utility
has been modified for this.  [jonsd]
